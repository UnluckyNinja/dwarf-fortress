Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress
--------------------------

ABOUT
`````
Dwarf Fortress is a single-player fantasy game. You can control a dwarven outpost or an adventurer in a randomly generated, persistent world.

Although Dwarf Fortress is still in a work in progress, many features have already been implemented.

* The world is randomly generated with distinct civilizations spanning over 1000 years of detailed history, dozens of towns, hundreds of caves and regions with various wildlife.
* The world persists as long as you like, over many games, recording historical events and tracking changes.
* Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in the mountain.

  - Craft treasures and furniture from many materials and improve these objects with precious metals, jewels and more.
  - Defend yourself against attacks from hostile civilizations, the wilderness and the depths.
  - Support the nobility as they make demands of your populace.
  - Keep your dwarves happy and read their thoughts as they work and relax.
  - Z coordinate allows you to dig out fortresses with multiple levels. Build towers or conquer the underworld.
  - Build floodgates to divert water for farming or to drown your adversaries... and don't forget the magma!
  - Surgery, sutures, splints, crutches and more: care for your wounded dwarves instead of leaving them to fend for themselves.
  - Much much more...

* Play an adventurer and explore, quest for glory or seek vengeance.

  - Meet adversaries from previous games.
  - Recruit people in towns to come with you on your journey.
  - Explore without cumbersome plot restrictions.
  - Seamlessly wander the world -- up to 197376 x 197376 squares total -- or travel more rapidly on the region map.
  - Travel by day and search for a place to shelter as night falls.
  - Accept quests from the town and civilization leaders.
  - Retire and meet your old characters. Bring them along on an adventure with a new character or reactivate them and play directly.
  - Z coordinate allows you to move between twisting underground caverns and scale structures, fighting adversaries above and below.
  - Earn a reputation as a hero with the various civilizations in the world.

* The combat model uses skills, body parts, individual tissues, material properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, one-time opportunities, charging and dodging between squares, bleeding, pain, nausea, various poison effects and much more.
* A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity and air masses to create fronts, clouds, rain storms and blizzards.
* Over two hundred rock and mineral types are incorporated into the world, placed in their proper geological environments.
* Add new creatures, weapons, plants, metals and other objects via modifiable text files.
* Extended ASCII character set rendered in 16 colors (including black) as well as 8 background colors (including black).
